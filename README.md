### ⚠️ Public anisette servers are now safe on SideStore 0.4.0 SideStore 0.4.0 introduced anisette-v3 servers, which are creating custom anisette data for each device, and thus are not subject to locking as the older servers were. Thus, you can safely use SideStore without worrying about setting up a custom anisette server. ⚠️

# my-SideStore-Anisette-docker-compose
SideStore is a fork of AltStore that doesn't require an AltServer.
